# [Typography on the web](https://typographyontheweb.com/)

A starting point for web designers and developers to learn more about typography.

Web designers and developers are going to shape the coming years of global visual communication. We still don’t yet have the level of control on the web as we have in print, and until we do we cannot fully explore what the medium holds for type. We cannot forget the centuries of work that has gone into figuring out solutions to similar problems, albeit in different contexts. We need to learn how to make better informed typographic decisions and not be put off by typography.

This list of resources and references aims to help web professionals dig deeper into typography. It is by no means a definitive list, and it is still a work in progress. I don’t want this to be a place that list every single resource ever, but somewhere to refer to and view an up to date selection of good material.


## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. To add / change / update anything, please either create an issue or fork and DIY.

I’ve added a simple gulp setup so you can run the page locally and update styles etc.

1. In Terminal `cd` into the directory
2. Run `npm install -g gulp` to get gulp setup globally (this might need `sudo`)
3. Run `npm install` to get the dependencies running

Once that is done you can start the server with `gulp` and stop it with `ctrl` + `c`.

The page will run at http://localhost:1234/

The page uses Sass which compiles to CSS. Make changes in the Sass folder and the page will reload automagically with the changes. The Base folder contains site wide base styles and the Modules folder has some page styles. It is build with [Sassline](https://github.com/designbyjake/sassline).
